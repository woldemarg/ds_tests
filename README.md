What is Shin-Chitose? - https://www.japan-guide.com/forum/quereadisplay.html?0+57892
New Chitose Airport - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chitose_Airport

My assumptions:
1. Citizens rent a car to get to/out of the airport
2. Citizens rent a car to get to events in another city
3. Rental frequency might depend on day of week and holiday
4. Rental frequency might depend on company name and car park available

Data available for predictioning:
1. Day of week
2. Schedule of events in neighbourhood areas
3. Weather forecast
4. Company name
5. Car class

Hypothesis:
1. Do number of cancellations correspond with a bad weather conditions (suggesting changes in flight schedule)?
2. Will introducing such a new feature as car_company with further target encoding by average price per day improve our model?


Further improvements:
1. Maket schedule of flights available for forecasting
2. Somehow estimate activity of competitors for a given company
3. Take into account a distance to the event based on event's coordinates
